    <!--Angelica's Favorite Film-->
    <h1><strong>Heneral Luna</strong> (2015) (Film)</h1>
    <p>Description: A historical film depicting the life of General Antonio Luna during the Philippine-American War.</p>

   <p>Insight: The film provides a powerful look at historical events and leadership, shedding light on a significant period in Philippine history. It also gives a lot of 
       advice about being a Filipino and how General Luna fought for the rights of the Filipinos even though he was being trampled on.
   </p>
   <h2><strong>Magnifico</strong> (2003) (Film)</h2>
   <p>Description: A drama about a young boy’s impact on his family and community.</p>
   <p>Insight: The film's portrayal of family and community values is both heartwarming and thought-provoking. This is one of the most memorable movies I watched when I was young because it revolves around the family and the main character's connection with other people, and it's a bit sad because he made a coffin for his grandmother but used it for his funeral.</p>
   <h2><strong>The Autopsy of Jane Doe</strong> (Film)</h2>
   <p>Description: A supernatural horror film centered around a father-son coroner team who uncover mysterious details during an autopsy.</p>
   <p>Insight: The film's suspenseful and compelling experience is enhanced by its blend of mystery and terror. There is a triggering storyline twist in this horror film, which makes it one of the most horrific ones I viewed in high school. I will suggest this one if you enjoy horror.</p>

   <h3><strong>'Diborsyo', Dokumentaryo ni Atom Araullo</strong> (Documentary)</h3>
   <p>Description: A documentary exploring the complexities of divorce in the Philippines.</p>
   <p>Insight: This documentary offers a varied perspective on divorce, focusing on both emotional and societal consequences. It's also one of the films that I enjoyed since it provides a distinct view on the documentary itself, different perspectives on people, and, of course, changing times.</p>

   <h3><strong>I-Witness: 'Tahimik na Sigaw', Dokumentaryo ni Mariz Umali</strong> (Documentary)</h3>
   <p>Description: A documentary focusing on silent struggles within a community.</p>
   <p>Insight: The focus on underrepresented struggles offers valuable insights into community dynamics.</p>
   <h3><strong>'The Silent Teacher,' Dokumentaryo ni Mav Gonzales</strong> (Documentary)</h3>
   <p>Description: A look at the impact of a dedicated teacher on their students’ lives.</p>
   <p>Insight: This documentary demonstrates the powerful impact that instructors can have on their students futures. I recently watched this video, and it was enjoyable because the teachers and students' experiences are shared by many others. One of my favorite parts was the investigation of the human body, which is in short supply, as well as the apparatus used to maintain it.

    <!--Joan's Favorite film-->
    <h2><strong>Parasite</strong> (2019) (Film)</h2>
    <p>Description: Parasite follows the Kim family, who live in poverty in a cramped semi-basement apartment. When the son, Ki-woo, gets a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family, the Kims cunningly infiltrate the Parks’ household, each securing a job without revealing they’re related.</p>
    <p>Insight:The film critiques class disparity, contrasting the lives of the struggling Kim family with the oblivious, privileged Park family.</p>
    <h2><strong>Inception</strong> (2010) (Film)</h2>
    <p>Description: Inception follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in the art of "extraction"—stealing valuable secrets from within the subconscious during dreams.</p>
    <p>Insight:The film’s layered dream structure challenges the audience to question what’s real and what’s not. Its non-linear storytelling mirrors the complexity of the subconscious mind.</p>

    <!--Joan's Favorite Book-->
    <h2><strong>The Midnight Library</strong> (2020) (Book)</h2>
    <p>Description: The Midnight Library follows Nora Seed, a woman struggling with depression and regret who finds herself in a magical library after a near-death experience. </p>
    <p>Insight:The book explores mental health, the weight of regret, and the philosophical question, "What if?" It encourages readers to reflect on how small decisions can shape life’s trajectory.</p>
    <h2><strong>It Ends With Us</strong> (2016) (Book)</h2>
    <p>Description: It Ends with Us follows Lily Bloom, a young woman who’s worked hard to build the life she’s always wanted. When she meets Ryle Kincaid, a confident and ambitious neurosurgeon, sparks fly, and their chemistry is undeniable.  </p>
    <p>Insight:This isn’t a typical romance—it delves into complex issues like domestic abuse, self-worth, and the courage to break toxic cycles. The characters are flawed and deeply human, which makes the story resonate on a personal level for many readers.</p>
